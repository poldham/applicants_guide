# Step One: General

This section of the application form helps the system to determine what permits you will need for your proposed project. This is based on the answer to simple yes/no questions. 

An answer is required to each question in order to work out which permits you are likely to need. 

In a small number of cases you may need a specialised permit that is not included in the online system. You can find these and links to the forms in the _Other Permits_ section of the guide. A link is also provided in the system itself.
