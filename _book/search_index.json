This guide has been prepared to assist you through each step of the online research permit and ABS system. The guide will take you through: Documents you need to provide Each step in the online system Expectations about project impact and benefit-sharing Additional specialist permits that may be required in some cases. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Bahamas Research and ABS Permit System provides a one stop shop to obtain all the main permits to conduct research involving biodiversity and genetic resources. We also provide information on specialist permits that you may require. The system is designed to make it easy to apply for all the major permits that may be associated with a research project. At the same time, the system addresses access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing under the Nagoya Protocol under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. This involves a requirement for an agreement to between your home institution and the government of the Bahamas. "],["documents.html", "Chapter 3 Documents", " Chapter 3 Documents You will need the following documents: Registration A copy of your current passport (pdf format). Needed at Registration. A passport size photo. Bahamas/US standard. Minimum 600 pixels by 600 pixels, maximum 1200 by 1200 pixels. The image must be in colour (24 bits per pixel) in sRGB colour space. jpeg or png format Step 3 An authorization letter from your home organization. A short letter signed by your host institution authorizing you to apply to conduct research in the Bahamas. A copy of your research proposal and budget as submitted or approved by the funding agency. This must include the budget as submitted or approved. It should also include details of any partner organisations (e.g. who form part of a consortium). Resume (Curriculum Vitae) Data Management Plan. This should include information on arrangements for the storage of specimens or samples that you propose to collect in the Bahamas and related data, including genetic sequence data. If you are importing or exporting any specimens you will require a permit from the Animal Import Section of the Department of Agriculture CITES Certificate (if applicable). If you are intending to transport material or specimens covered by CITES through the Bahamas you will need to provide the original CITES permit from the country of origin. 3.0.1 Other Permits A number of other more specialist permits may be required Animal Import/Export. CITES certificate. CITES Certificate (if applicable). If you are intending to transport material or specimens covered by CITES through the Bahamas you will need to provide the original CITES permit from the country of origin. Chainsaw Permit.

The system also requires all applicants to provide a free ORCID identifier. ORCID is a free persisent researcher identifier that stays with a researcher throughout their careers. An ORCID profile is under the control of the researcher themselves and they can choose to make information public or private. The advantage of ORCID ids for researchers are that they allow information on their employment, research funding and publications to be stored in one place. In particular, the publication profile can be automatically updated through services such as Crossref. This makes it easier for us to create an electronic archive of research publications about the Bahamas and reduces the need to send emails. 4.0.1 Passport You are required to provide a pdf copy of your passport as part of the registration process. You are required to provide a passport photo as part of the registration process. The passport photo should be the standard size for the Bahamas and is the same as in the United States and European Union countries. 4.0.1.1 Electronic images requirements Format should be jpeg or png 600 pixels by 600 pixels minimum and maximum 1200 by 1200 pixels. The image must be in colour (24 bits per pixel) in sRGB colour space. Many high street services offer this kind of service and will email a photo to you. 4.0.1.2 Scanning an Existing Image If you are scanning an existing image the photo itself must be: 51mm x 51mm (2 x 2 inches) Scanned at a resultion of 300 pixels per inche (or 12 pixels per millimeter) 4.0.2 The Applicant Home Page When you have logged into the system you will find yourself at your home page. This allows you to create new applications, to retrieve the details of existing applications and review invoices for application fees. 4.0.3 Communications from Desk Officers The desk officers at permit granting authorities may need to contact you with questions such as on locations, the size of samples, methods etc. This is handled over emails generated by the system and the communications are automatically stored as part of the file history for the application. "],["step-one-general.html", "Chapter 5 Step One: General", " Chapter 5 Step One: General This section of the application form helps the system to determine what permits you will need for your proposed project. This is based on the answer to simple yes/no questions. An answer is required to each question in order to work out which permits you are likely to need. In a small number of cases you may need a specialised permit that is not included in the online system. You can find these and links to the forms in the Other Permits section of the guide. A link is also provided in the system itself. "],["final-words.html", "Chapter 6 Final Words", " Chapter 6 Final Words We have finished a nice book.

"],["benefit-sharing.html", "Chapter 8 Benefit-Sharing", " Chapter 8 Benefit-Sharing The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) introduced the concept of benefit-sharing arising from the utilisation of genetic resources. In 2010 governments who are parties to the CBD adopted The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. Under the Nagoya Protocol governments may agree to grant prior informed consent to access genetic resources within their jurisdictions and to establish what are known as “mutually agreed terms” on benefit-sharing with those seeking to use these resources for commercial or non-commercial purposes. An Annex to the Nagoya Protocol provides an indicative list of Monetary and Non-monetary Benefits that is useful in considering forms of benefit-sharing. What this means in practice is that all applicants seeking to conduct research involving biodiversity or the traditional knowledge of communities in the Bahamas are required to set out the benefits that will be shared. Benefit-sharing can be considered to be similar to the concepts of research impact or project legacy in so far that research is expected to have positive impacts Benefit-sharing can take many forms. Researchers seeking to conduct research in the Bahamas may also be at different stages in their careers, with different means and budgets. Our expectations about benefit-sharing will recognise the diversity of means and will be proportionate to the means available to the individual and to the project. Our aim is to ensure a measurable return to the conservation of biodiversity in the Bahamas and its communities. Benefit-sharing can take many forms and is commonly divided into monetary and non-monetary forms. Early stage researchers (such as undergraduates, masters and PhD students) will be expected to think about how to offer benefits in kind. These might include contributions to community activities during your research, organising local events during your stay (such as a Cafe Scientifique) that contribute to community knowledge and understanding of biodiversity related research or benefit communities in the Bahamas in other ways. Researchers in this group are invited to list proposed activity and to provide estimates of the monetary value or its equivalent. Established researchers will generally hold significant research grants and manage research teams. Researchers in this group may also lead or form part of consortiums of organisations including private sector entities. Reseachers in this grouping will be expected to provide clear, quantifiable evidence of direct benefit-sharing in the Bahamas that will leave a measurble legacy in the . This should be reflected in budget allocations and the ability to calculate the percentage of the overall budget that will be spent in the Bahamas. Research activities involving benefit-sharing may include, but are not limited to: Workshops Training courses Conferences Exchange Visits Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD studentships Equipment that remains in the Bahamas Shared authorship of data and data products arising from research Joint publications with local researchers (including publication costs for open access publications) Joint ownership or control of intellectual property (know how, trade secrets, patents, copyright, trademarks) arising from the utilisation of genetic resources The distinction between purely non-commercial and commercial research has become increasingly fuzzy in the context of the drive to promote income generation from research activity (e.g. arising from the Bayh-Dole Act). Applications that involve a commercial dimension will be expected to be explicit about proposed benefit-sharing with the government of the Bahamas.
