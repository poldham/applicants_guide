"],["registering-with-the-system.html", "Registering with the System Your Home Page Communications with Desk Officers", " Registering with the System Status: Working Draft When registering you will create a free username and password with your email address. The system also requires all applicants to provide a free ORCID identifier. ORCID is a free persisent researcher identifier that stays with a researcher throughout their careers. An ORCID profile is under the control of the researcher themselves and they can choose to make information public or private. The advantage of ORCID ids for researchers are that they allow information on their employment, research funding and publications to be stored in one place. In particular, the publication profile can be automatically updated through services such as Crossref. This makes it easier for us to create an electronic archive of research publications about the Bahamas and reduces the need to send emails. Passport Instructions You are required to provide a pdf copy of your current passport as part of the registration process. Passport Photo Requirements You are required to provide a passport photo as part of the registration process. The passport photo should be the standard size for the Bahamas and is the same as in the United States and European Union countries.

In 2010 governments who are parties to the CBD adopted The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. Under the Nagoya Protocol governments may agree to grant prior informed consent to access genetic resources within their jurisdictions and to establish what are known as “mutually agreed terms” on benefit-sharing with those seeking to use these resources for commercial or non-commercial purposes. An Annex to the Nagoya Protocol provides an indicative list of Monetary and Non-monetary Benefits that is useful in considering forms of benefit-sharing.
