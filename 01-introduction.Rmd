The Bahamas Research and ABS Permit System provides a one stop shop to obtain all the main permits to conduct research involving biodiversity and genetic resources. We also provide information on specialist permits that you may require.

The system is designed to make it easy to apply for all the major permits that may be associated with a research project. At the same time, the system addresses access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing under the Nagoya Protocol under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. This involves a requirement for an agreement to between your home institution and the government of the Bahamas.
